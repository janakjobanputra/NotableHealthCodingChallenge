This is a Simple App created with AngularJS and Python Flask.

The front end was bootstrapped with [Angular Material Dashboard](http://flatlogic.github.io/angular-material-dashboard/#/dashboard).
The back end is a simple python flask backend with two apis.

The requirements were outlined [here](https://github.com/janakjobanputra/NotableHealthCodingChallenge/blob/master/SWE%20Challenge%20--%20Notable%20Calendar.pdf).
